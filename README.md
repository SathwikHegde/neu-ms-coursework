## Semester-wise Breakdown

### Fall 2021

#### INFO 5100 - Application Engineering and Development

* \[*Practices social-technical software engineering methods and tools to solve real-world problems. Explores innovative design and programming
techniques to build significant business applications quickly. Studies the process of systematically combining UX techniques, business processes,
and complex data models to assemble applications that are user-friendly and meet business requirements. Employs the object-oriented paradigm,
visual user interface design principles, and programming languages such as Java, as well as productivity tools, to put together complicated, powerful
business applications with ease. Explores the art of how to systematically write software programs to solve any business problem, through practicing
simple and smart ways of making software programming enjoyable.
*]
* **Key Skills:** Java, Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures

#### DAMG 6210 - Data Management and Database Design

* \[*Studies design of information systems from a data perspective for engineering and business applications; data modeling, including entity-relationship (E-R) and object approaches; user-centric information requirements and data sharing; fundamental concepts of database management systems (DBMS) and their applications; alternative data models, with emphasis on relational design; SQL; data normalization; data-driven application design for personal computer, server-based, enterprise-wide, and Internet databases; and distributed data applications.*]
* **Key Skills:** SQL, Database Modeling, Relational Database Design

### Spring 2022

#### INFO 6150 - Web Design and User Experience Engineering

* \[*Focuses on advanced user interface engineering, with a strong emphasis on utility and personalized user experiences development. Through the use
of tools like React and Flutter, explores how to engineer highly personalized web applications tailored to individual user needs and preferences. Topics
include responsive layouts, interactive elements, animation integration, and performance tuning. Offers students an opportunity to gain hands-on
experience in building interfaces that dynamically adapt to user behavior, preferences, and context, ensuring a unique and engaging experience for
each user.*]
* **Key Skills:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, UX Design Principles

#### INFO 6105 - Data Science Engineering Methods and Tools

* \[*Introduces the fundamental techniques for machine learning and data science engineering. Discusses a variety of machine learning algorithms, along
with examples of their implementation, evaluation, and best practices. Lays the foundation of how learning models are derived from complex data
pipelines, both algorithmically and practically. Topics include supervised learning (parametric/nonparametric algorithms, support vector machines,
kernels, neural networks, deep learning) and unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems). Based on numerous
real-world case studies.*]
